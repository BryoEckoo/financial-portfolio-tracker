 Angular project on a financial portfolio tracker:

Real-Time Data: Implement real-time data updates for stock prices, portfolio values, and news related to selected stocks. You can use WebSocket technology or APIs like WebSocket, WebSockets, or server-sent events (SSE) for this purpose.


User Authentication and Authorization: Develop a robust user authentication system with features like two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure user accounts. Implement role-based authorization to restrict certain actions to specific user roles (e.g., admin, standard user).


Data Visualization: Use Angular libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to create visually appealing and informative charts and graphs. Visualize the performance of individual stocks and the overall portfolio over time.


Customizable Dashboards: Allow users to customize their dashboard by adding, removing, or rearranging widgets. Widgets can include stock charts, news feeds, financial ratios, and more.


Mobile App: Create a mobile version of your portfolio tracker using Angular and a framework like Ionic or NativeScript to reach a broader audience.


Stock Screener: Add a stock screener feature that allows users to filter and search for stocks based on various criteria such as market cap, P/E ratio, dividend yield, etc.


Portfolio Analysis: Provide in-depth portfolio analysis tools, such as risk assessment, diversification analysis, and performance attribution. Users could gain insights into how their investments are performing and where they might need to make adjustments.


Alerts and Notifications: Implement an alert system that notifies users when a stock in their portfolio reaches a certain price or when there is significant news related to their holdings.


Tax Optimization: Offer tax optimization suggestions for users based on their portfolio, helping them minimize their tax liabilities through strategies like tax-loss harvesting.


Social Features: Enable social sharing and interaction among users. Users could follow each other's portfolios, discuss investment strategies, and share insights.


News Sentiment Analysis: Analyze news articles related to stocks in the portfolio and provide sentiment analysis to help users gauge market sentiment regarding their investments.


Education Center: Create a section with educational resources, articles, and videos on investing, financial planning, and market analysis to help users make informed decisions.


Integration with Brokers: If possible, integrate with brokerage APIs to allow users to execute trades directly from the portfolio tracker.


Multi-Currency Support: If your audience includes international users, implement multi-currency support to track investments in different currencies and provide currency conversion features.


Portfolio Sharing: Allow users to share their portfolio performance publicly or with specific individuals, such as financial advisors or family members, while maintaining privacy controls.


Remember to consider the legal and regulatory aspects of offering financial advice or trading features, as this may vary by jurisdiction. Always prioritize user data security and privacy in your project.
